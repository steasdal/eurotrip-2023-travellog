# Sam & Carla's ADD Adventure 2023 - Travel Log

## Flights
We flew business class on United from Charleston to Newark to Rome.  Left Charleston on Wednesday morning.  Mom was nice enough to drop us off at Charleston airport.  Got there with plenty of time to spare -  we were through security in about five minutes.  Chilled at our gate for a couple of hours until it was time to board.

### First Flight - Charleston to Newark
Charleston to Newark was easy peasey.  We had a couple of business/first class seats at the front of the plane right next to each other.  Enjoyed some snacks.

### Newark Airport
Chilled in the Polaris lounge.  The food was excellent and the drinks were free.  Carla never realized that United Club drinks are complimentary.  I wished I had some cash to tip the very nice bartenders, though.  I'll try to remember to bring some next time.  Did a little bit of work by remotely logging into the work lappie back at home.  Boss let the team go early so I didn't have to get much done.  In no time at all - maybe too soon - it was time to board the next flight.

### Second flight - Newark to Rome
We were on a Boeing 777 for the big leg of the journey.  I had never been on one before but knew roughly what to expect.  I think this was a 777-200 - it certainly held a lot of people.  We got to the gate at nearly the perfect moment - group one was just starting to file onto the plane.  We found or business class seats next to each other and settled in.  I have to admit I felt just a slight bit guilty with all of the steerage-class passengers jealously eyeing our luxurious accommodations as they filed past on their way back to their economy seats... but it only lasted for a few moments.

There was a technical issue that delayed us by about 20-30 minutes.  Maintenance signed off and we taxied out just a little behind schedule and were airborne in no time.  The flight was just over seven hours total.  We both jumped on the free T-Mobile WiFi and were able to text, chat, and send pics durning the flight.  Thanks T-Mobile!  We do love the perk and hope it never goes away.

Overall the flight was pretty smooth.  We did hit a couple of bumpy patches but they didn't last long.  We both agreed that the cabin was a little bit too warm unfortunately which contributed to us being unable to get any sleep.  They immediately started throwing food and drinks at us and did not stop.  We had a full meal service, lights out, snack about half way, lights back on, then breakfast.  All over the course of seven hours.

After lights out, we both reclined our seats to the full sleeping position and tried to get a few winks.  Despite finding some perfectly comfortable sleeping positions, my brain just wasn't willing to shut off.  Eventually, I gave up, un-reclined my seat a bit, and read some more of my book (book 8 of the Wheel of Time series).

Within about 30 minutes of finishing up breakfast, we were descending.  In no time at all we were on the ground at FCO "Leonardo Di Vinci" Airport.

## Day One - Rome

* Arrival
* Hotel
* Villa Borghese
* Pantheon
* Dinner
* Trevi Fountain
* Hotel Rooftop Bar
* Spanish Steps

We didn't check any luggage so we disembarked the plane with our carry-ons and headed for the exit.  The path to get from the gate was hilariously twisty and circuitous - a perfect intro to the chaos of Rome.  After walking what seemed like a mile or so, we finally found our way out to the taxi stand.  While trying to figure out the protocol for getting a taxi, no fewer than four dudes tried to talk us into taking a clandestine private vehicle.  We waved them all off.

After the warm cabin of the airplane and the grandma's house hotness of the airport, stepping out into the 60 degree Italian air was heavenly.  We found a cab - I think we might have cut in front of some Italians who may have uttered a few Italian curses - and were on our way to the hotel.  The ride - like all cab rides in Rome - was thrilling and hilarious.  Our hotel was in the northern part of the city center.  There are no big roads leading into the center of rome.  All traffic eventually funnels off of the freeway and into... well, basically, just two lane streets and alleyways.  It's really hard to describe what getting around Rome is like in a taxi.  You just have to experience it.  In a word, it's bananas.  Every time.  Every trip.

Our taxi ride took us past a bunch of amazing sights - not hard in Rome; amazing sighs are everywhere - and our driver tried to explain what we were looking at with his very limited english.

We eventually made it to our hotel, the Sina Bernini Bristol, and unloaded.  Overall, the hotel was really excellent and we'd definitely stay there again.  The building itself had history going back over a hundred years and hosted many celebrities and dignitaries over the years.  It was apparently the first building in all of rome that was designed and built to _be_ a hotel.

The front desk ladies were very kind and accommodating.  They offered to give us a temporary room to hang out in until our actual room was ready.  We declined that offer and, instead, had them hold onto our luggage while we went out and explored.  We headed left out of our hotel and up the hill to the [Villa Borghese](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Borghese) park.  We explored the park for maybe 30 minutes and both started to get low on energy.  We exited the park the same way we came in and found a coffee shop where we ordered a couple of lattes.  These didn't even begin to take the edge off so we walked back down the hill to the hotel and took the desk clerks up on the offer of a temporary room after all.  We hit the bed in that room and crashed harder than anyone has ever crashed in the history of humankind.  I think that was around 11:00 AM local time.

We awoke almost exactly at 3:00 PM to a phone call from the front desk letting us know our actual room was ready.  At some point, one of the concierge's hench men brought our suitcases up to the temporary room so we had all of our bags with us already.  We checked into our actual room, unpacked a bit, and decided to head out to see the town.

We were both feeling pretty good after our nap time so we decided to head out on foot.  We walked down the main drag that began just at the end of the roughly rectangular piazza that our hotel fronted for a while.  This street, the name of which I never learned, is like the Rodeo Drive of this part of town.  Lots of high-end shops and some lower end tourist traps, too.  Google Maps guided us to the Pantheon.  We bought a couple of 5 Euro tickets at the kiosk and went on in.  Neither of us knew much about the Pantheon so we looked up some facts on our phones.  Another shout-out to T-Mobile for the 5GB of free high-speed (LTE) data that we get each day over here.

Anyway, turns out the Pantheon is OLD AS F**K!  It was built between 115-123 CE.  It was a Roman temple until 609 CE at which time it was turned into a Catholic Church.  How crazy is that?  In continuous operation for nearly two thousand years!?!?  Mind blown.  We wandered around the interior marveling at all there is to see and exited.

We looked up a few restaurants and picked on with a 4.8 rating on Google Maps called [La Tavernetta 48](https://www.latavernetta48.com/).  It was in a tiny little piazza - barely more than a widened alley - away from the main drag.  It was absolutely perfect.  We took a table outside where cars and motorcycle putted by several times.  The food was excellent.  We had some bruschetta which was so fresh and tasty.  I had spaghetti carbonara which was quite excellent but Carla had some kind of pasta that was covered in shaved black truffles and, mama mia, it was mind blowing.  The waiter talked us into a bottle of local white wine which was very, very good.  The bill wasn't bad at all and you gotta' love the whole no tipping thing over here.

After dinner, we walked to [Piazza Navona](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Navona) - a long, gorgeous rectangular piazza with multiple fountains - that Carla had stumbled upon on a previous trip and grabbed some Gelato.  After snapping a few pics, finishing our gelato, and fighting off a dozen or so souvenir vendors, we made a beeline for the [Trevi Fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevi_Fountain).  We marveled at its splendor for a few minutes and moved on.

Back at the hotel, we hit the rooftop bar for a couple of glasses of really excellent wine and a tiny appetizer.  The view from the rooftop is spectacular featuring a view of the very front of St. Peter's Basilica.  We made use of one of the many propane tornado flame heaters because it was getting a little chilly.  While admiring the truly world class view, we decided that we had regained enough energy to walk over to the Spanish Steps.

After grabbing some light jackets, we headed back out.  The walk maybe a kilometer before we found ourselves at the bottom of the legendary [Spanish Steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Steps).  I'm not sure I'd ever even seen a picture before so I didn't know what to expect.  Turns out it's a huge, resplendent set of 135 magnificent marble steps and terraces carved into the side of a small hill.  We walked up very one of 'em stopping at several spots along the way to get some federally mandated pics and selfies.

Finally, once our heart rates came back down, we made our way back to the hotel and turned in for the night.  Despite our earlier nap, we both didn't seem to have any trouble getting to sleep though we did wake up pretty early the next morning.  The beds in the Sina Bernini were very comfortable though our bed was just a pair of twins shoved together.  

Shout out to the little USB-powered travel fans that we brought along with us.   We had the window open as far as it would go - which wasn't far - to let in the cool night air but even so the room was a bit stuffy.  Our two little fans - one for each bedside table - were absolutely clutch in keeping a bit of air moving and cooling things off just the perfect amount.  So glad I brought 'em along.

## Day Two - Rome

* Breakfast
* St. Peters Basilica
* Lunch
* Colosseum
* Basilica di Santa Francesca Romana
* Ruins
* Metro to Hotel
* Nap
* Apple Store
* Hotel Rooftop Bar
* Sora Margherita
* River Stroll/Gelato
* Hotel

We both popped out of bed wide awake somewhere around 6:15 AM.  After freshening up and preparing for a long day of sightseeing, we headed up to floor 8 for the breakfast buffet.  It was _amazing_.  This buffet had everything you could possible want including eggs, sausage, & bacon, fresh breads, cereals, pastries, flaky croissants, veggies, waffles, tons of fruits both fresh and preserved, on-demand cappuccinos, etc.  We tried to get in and out with consuming only a slightly ridiculous amount of calories but it was tough.

After that truly marvelous breakfast, it was off to St. Peters Basilica for our pre-booked tour at 8:45 AM.  Our cab ride from the hotel to St. Peters's square was, as usual, thrilling, hilarious, and a but perilous (again, like every cab ride in Rome).  Our driver dropped us off at the end of this little alley which was kind of the back way into St. Peters square.  It was perfect though the handful of Italian soldiers sporting submachine guns made Carla a little nervous.

Side note:  most cab drivers are perfectly happy to accept contactless credit card payments.  All of them _will_ accept credit cards but only most of them are happy about it.  This morning's driver was a little grumbly, asking first if I had cash and then only reluctantly pulling out the contactless payment terminal after I convinced him that I didn't have any cash.

I never actually did get any cash from an ATM machine our whole time in rome and I didn't need any.  I don't think I ever needed to pull out my wallet at all, now that I think of it; we were able to use contactless Apple Pay via our phones for absolutely every transaction including taxis and the turnstiles in the Metro.  But I digress...

We had a little bit of trouble figuring out where to meet our tour group so Carla called some phone number, couldn't understand the lady on the other end, and shoved the phone into my hand assuming that I'd have a better time of it.  Turns out I did and the very patient, very understanding lady on the phone played a little game of hotter/colder with me until I found the Italian gent holding a little yellow sign indicating the meeting spot for our tour.  He told us that our tour guide for today's tour would be Francesca.

And, oh boy, let me tell you about Francesca.  Good lord she was hilarious.  Sometimes even intentionally.  She did an excellent job imbuing even the darker subjects with breezy hilarity (e.g. St. Peter's martyrdom) and really made the tour a blast.  Her slightly lazy eye and three-packs-a-day voice didn't hurt.  10/10.

The basilica itself is indescribable.  It's so monumental and overwhelming that Carla actually started tearing up when we first entered... and we're not even Catholic!  It really was something to behold.  The mind has trouble taking it all in, honestly.  I think we snapped a couple of hundred pics between the two of us and they don't even begin to do the basilica justice.

The tour took us through the main sanctuary and down into the crypt.  At the end of the tour, Francesca took us to the booth where the dome climb tickets are purchased and acquired the tickets for our entire group.  She then walked us to the elevator (one young, hearty couple opted to bypass the lift and take the stairs _all_ the way up) and bid us arrivederci.  Carla & I demanded a selfie with Francesca and told her several times how much we enjoyed the tour.

The lift basically dumped us out on the roof of the main sanctuary where there's a tiny cafe and souvenir shop.  We had built up quite a thirst during the roughly two miles of walking that the tour required (did I mention the place is big)? and grabble some refreshments.  We discussed whether Carla should actually attempt climbing the 320 steps up to the top of the dome and, ultimately, decided that doing so would probably ruin her left knee for the remainder of the trip.  Thus, I set off on the climb by myself.  

In the end, my hips and knees held out fine but I just barely had the cardio to make it to the top.  It was _not_ easy.  There were stairs that doubled back and forth.  There were ramps that turned into stairs.  There were stairs and ramps where the walls were slanted inwards towards the interior of the dome which gave me vertigo.  The worst section, however, was a chunk of narrow spiral stairs that just seemed to go on forever.  I climbed and climbed and eventually just resigned myself to the fact that this was my life now.  I'd just climb spiral stairs until I died.  But alas!  They did eventually end.  And then there were more stairs.  I got to _another_ section of spiral stairs that were even narrower than the first and after only a couple of stories worth of those, I was at the top!  I had made it!  After resting for a few days to allow my heart rate to come down, I make a couple of laps around the walkway and snapped some crazy pics of Rome, the Vatican, and the Papal Gardens.  Maybe juuuuuust worth the climb.

The trip back down was much easier and was over in two shakes.  Unfortunately, the exit was on the other side of the main sanctuary from where Carla was waiting.  After we texted back and forth a few times trying to figure out a strategy, I realized that I could get back to here side without having the make the full climb in reverse.  We met back up, took the elevator back down to the main floor of St. Peter's, took a last few glances at its stunning magnificence, and joined the throngs of people that were attempting to figure out how to get back out into the square.

By the time we made of of St. Pete's Square, it was time to get some lunch.  There was a highly rated place nearby called La Fraschetta di Castel Sant’Angelo
so we walked on over.  They didn't open for another 15 minutes but they were nice enough to let us sit in the outdoor cafe section and even brought us some sparkling water & bread.  The food was good but a little too rich.  We ordered a charcuterie board for two which was entirely too much food.  It included something like nine different types of pork products.

After lunch, we decided it was time to head towards the Colosseum so Carla summoned a taxi through her Uber app.  Due to construction, we were dropped off about a half kilometer away and walked the rest.  We didn't go in the Colosseum but snapped plenty of pics of the exterior and read about the history.

We strolled around a bit taking in the nearby ruins and wound up in Basilica di Santa Francesca Romana which was incredible and incredibly old.  Look it up.

We were getting a tired at this point and decided to head back to the hotel for a break.  I talked Carla into taking the metro since there was a station right next to the Colosseum and our hotel was only four stops (and one transfer) away.  The Metro was **packed** full of people but we made it back to the Metro station almost under our hotel in no time at all.  I want to say it was somewhere around 2:00 PM.  We talked to the concierge about the best place around to get Jewish artichokes - a local delicacy - and he called a place around the corner called Tullio to make a reservation for 9:30 PM (the earliest they could get us in)

The plan was to rest for a little while and then head back out for some more touristy stuff.  I fell asleep and woke up roughly three hours later.  The jet lag was still hitting me pretty hard, it would seem.

After nap time, I walked down the main drag to find the Apple Store.  I had broken the band on my apple watch trying to get my giant backpack on the day before and needed a replacement.  I was told by the gent who sold me my new watchband that I was in Europe's largest Apple Store.  I was built in a giant historic building and really was quite magnificent with tons of white marble and gold trim everywhere.

After walking back to the hotel, carla and I wandered back up to the roofop bar to soak in a little more of that spectacular view and cash in our welcome-drink voucher.  Carla informed me that she didn't want to wait until 9:30 for dinner so we looked up some other places were we could get the famous Jewish artichokes.  They were all clustered in the exact same place - a little section of town down by a little island in the Tiber river.  I picked the joint with the best ratings and we grabbed the cab waiting in front of our hotel.  Our driver would do Soduku (I'm talking pencil and paper) whenever he stopped in traffic.

We arrived at Piazza della Cinque Scole and our driver dropped us off at the front door of Sola Margherita.  This was _exactly_ the place we were looking for.  It was just slightly larger than a broom closet and had probably been in continuous operation by the same family since the time of Emperor Nero himself.  The menu was hand written in Italian and the hostess/waitress/lady who wasn't taking s**t from anyone barely spoke any english at all.  We order a pair of Carciofi alla Guidia, a single plate of Cacio e Pepe, and half a liter of the hose white.  Everything arrived at our tiny corner table in, like, fifteen seconds and was fan-freakin'-tastic.  It was absolute perfection.  The noodles were made in house and couldn't possibly be any better.  The artichokes were just as good as I had been told they would be.  It was an excellent experience from top to bottom.  15/10 would recommend.

After all that, we walked over to the Tiber which was _right_ there and had a little stroll down the closest Gelato place.  The Gelato was excellent.  We jumped in a taxi which just happened to be sitting _right_ there and had probably our most thrilling taxi ride yet back to the hotel.  I honestly thought we were going to run a few pedestrians over at several points.  It was great.

After checking in with mumsy via FaceTime, it was time to shower, pack, and call it night.  Sleep came pretty easily once more despite the nap earlier in the day.

## Day Three - Milan

* Breakfast
* Train Ride
* Milano Centrale
* Hotel
* Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II
* Duomo de Milano
* Hotel

This one was a little weird.  We kind of might have slept a good chunk of this day away.  The jet lag was still hitting us pretty hard.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.

We woke up bright 'n early to catch the train to Milan.  We packed up all of our various and sundry personal effects, checked out of the hotel, and grabbed a cab that was very helpfully waiting right outside of our hotel room.  There seemed to always be one or two cabs waiting out front of the Sina Bernini all hours of the day.  It seems to be a hotel of at least some small amount of import.  Which reminds me: yesterday evening, as we were leaving to head out for one thing or another, a small three car motorcade with a police car and a couple of Alfo Romeo SUV's pulled up to the front of the hotel and unloaded someone (or someones) important.  We didn't recognize anyone.  I suspect that, with the right amount of money, any visitor to Rome could probably arrange such an escort.

The train station was a quick seven or eight minute cab ride from the hotel.  Once inside, we still had a solid 40 minutes or so before our train departed and we didn't even have a platform number yet so we hit the McCafe down in the basement for some breakfast.  I love visiting a McDonalds when I'm traveling overseas just to see what unusual local options are available.  Unfortunately, the breakfast menu was pretty standard except for the broad selection of pastries and coffee options.  We ordered a couple of cappuccinos, a couple of croissants, some scrambled eggs and a breakfast sandwich.  I was astounded to discover that the McCafe actually had a legit (albeit McDonalds branded) espresso machine with a barista attending to it.  The cappuccinos were remarkably good.  The croissants were of an acceptable european standard but the rest of the breakfast food was just OK.

I was checking the board frequently and, about ten minutes before departure, we finally were assigned a platform number.  We headed up to that platform to find our Frecciarossa 1000 waiting for us.  We boarded coach 3 and found our seats.  I booked a pair of business class seats facing each other across from a little table.  In just a couple of minutes, the train was zipping away from Roma Termini towards Milan smoothly and quietly.  It was a very smooth ride through the lovely Italian countryside.  The weather was clear an sunny affording us excellent views from our panoramic window.  The train stopped at only a single station between Rome and Milan.  Too soon, we were pulling into Milano Centrale.

I should mention that there was a dude sitting across the isle from us that we both agreed put of a reeeeeally weird vibe.  I can't quite explain it... he just did.

The train station, [Milano Centrale](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stazione_di_Milano_Centrale) is a mind blowing example of fascist architecture.  The scope and scale is hard to explain.  It was quite clearly designed and built to make one seem small.  It's worth a visit to Milan just to see this dire, imposing masterpiece in person.

Since the hotel was only about half a kilometer from the train station, we decided to hoof it.  This was my first opportunity to wear my double backpack in a back/front setup and it worked very well balancing the weight between the two packs.  I felt like I could walk a good long way with this configuration.

Immediately, the feel of Milan is completely different from rome.  It's a much more modern city laid out in a modern fashion.  Most of the architecture that we saw was super modern.

The hotel, the Duo Milan, is as modern as any other building in that part of Milan.  Carla's status got us a free upgrade so our room was a little bigger than the one in Rome which we appreciated.  This hotel had the smartest elevators that we've ever seen.  You'd scan your room key to call the lift and a little touchscreen would give you the option of only the floors you're allowed to visit.  For us, that was floor three, the floor our room was on, and floor twelve which housed the top floor restaurant.

After checking in, we decided to chill for a bit.  Carla was quite tired still so she laid down for a bit.  I had resolved not to take a nap today so I watched some YouTube videos for a bit.  After a half hour or so, the sleepies started hitting me pretty hard too so I laid down for a few minutes.  Just a few minutes.  We both awoke from our nap something like three and a half hours later.  Oh, yeah... before falling asleep, I had bought us a couple of tickets for the hop-on-hop-off big red bus.  When we awoke, there was only about an hour of time left before the bus stopped running so that was a nice fifty euro nap.

By the time we managed to extricate ourselves from our cozy hotel room, there was only an hour or so of light left in the day.  We grabbed a cab and headed downtown to the city center.  Since we only had so much time left, we could only hit a couple of sights so we chose the [Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_Vittorio_Emanuele_II) and the [Duomo di Milano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Cathedral).  It was the right choice.  Both were unbelievable.  Both were enormous and unimaginably grand.  At first glance, I guessed that the Duomo probably took over a hundred years to build.  Nope.  It took 500 years to build, only finishing up in the 1900's.  The Galleria was full of the most premium shops imaginable.  Both bordered on a giant piazza and were absolutely packed with people.  I'm not being hyperbolic here - movement was slow and deliberate due to the sheer amount of people.

As the sun set, the temperature dropped and the wind picked up and things got cold _quick_.  Carla was bundled up properly but the wind blew the heat out of me in minutes.  We hadn't eaten since our very early breakfast so we started looking for somewhere to get some dinner.  We had trouble finding anywhere nearby with a decent Google Maps rating so we just decided to walk around and find somewhere that looked good.  We rolled the dice and came up snake eyes.  The little place we chose was a complete tourist trap.  The food wasn't terrible but it was super basic and way overpriced.  Lesson learned.  At least it gave us a chance to  warm up, though.  While eating, Carla managed to find the place on Google Maps and discovered its 1/5 rating lol.  At least _that_ was good for a laugh.

After wandering around the Galleria for a little while longer, we decided that we'd had enough and were ready to head back to the hotel.  Unfortunately, we couldn't find a reasonably priced Uber from anywhere near the big piazza so we decided to take the metro, the entrance to which was in the piazza itself.  The metro dropped us off about 600 meters from the hotel so we just walked the rest of the way.

Back at the hotel, we were both somehow getting tired again so we turned in for the night around 9:30 PM.  Carla managed a pretty decent night's sleep.  I got maybe three hours of decent sleep than awoke around 1:00 AM and read until it was time to pack up and leave.  Maybe tomorrow will be better.

## Day Four - Zurich

* Breakfast
* Train Ride
* Arrival
* Hotel & Dinner
* Walkabout, Chocolate, Christmas Markets
* Downtown Christmas Celebration
* After-dark exploration
* Hotel

Ohhhhh baby!  This is it!  This is the big one!  This is the day that we've been anticipating since the trip began.  We didn't originally plan to stay in Milan overnight.  Rather, we were thinking of taking the train from Rome straight to Paris.  Doing that, however, meant that it might be dark during some or all of the train ride through the Swiss Alps and we didn't want to miss a single minute of that.  Thus, we broke the trip from Rome to Paris into a few days and intentionally left Milan on the earliest possible train so that we could savor every possible minute of Swiss alpine views.  Was it worth it?  Alas, I'm getting ahead of myself again!

We extricated ourselves from our comforter cocoon around 5:30 AM and started getting ready for the day.  Getting everything rounded up and packed is getting pretty rote by now so we found ourselves a bit ahead of schedule.  We took the extra time to make a couple of cups of coffee in the hotel room and chill for about twenty minutes.  At about 6:20 AM we made our way downstairs, checked out, and had the slightly sassy Italian overnight desk guy call us a cab.  The cab ride to Milano Centrale only took a couple of minutes.  Technically we could have walked to the station pretty easily but it was cold AF and we wanted to preserve as much of Carla's left knee walking capacity as we could for Paris.

We once again marveled at absolutely insane facade of the Milano Centrale station as our driver pulled around to the drop-off zone.  Just inside the entrance door was a little cafe that served a bunch of very good looking pastries and coffee.  We got in line and ordered a Nutella croissant, a pain au chocolate, and a pair of cappuccinos.  We grabbed a spot at one of the two little stand-up counters lining a couple of the walls and enjoyed our breakfast, all of which was quite good.

We went looking for an ascensore (elevator) but found instead a couple of people mover ramps that motivated us up to the platform level of the station a full twenty minutes before our scheduled train departure time.  The departure board unexpectedly showed that our train had already been assigned a platform so we headed on in to the platform area to find our train, the EuroCity 312, waiting on platform 6.  We found coach 9 and took seats 31 and 32, a pair of opposing first class seats facing each other over a little folding table.  The coach was a nice temp - not too warm and not too cold.  We plugged in our travel power strip, plugged some USB-C cables into _that_, got all the gadgets hooked up to the WiFi, and strapped in for what we hoped was going to be a four hour train ride full of spectacular views.  We were not disappointed.

We had the entire first class coach _almost_ too ourselves, sharing it only with a gent named Tim from Houston, TX.  Nice guy.  We chatted with him on and off for the duration of the trip.

The train pulled out of Milano Centrale exactly on time at 7:20 AM.  When we cleared the station, we found that the sky to the east was _just_ starting to lighten.  Already off to a gorgeous start.  The first half hour or so was more of the lovely rolling Italian countryside that we had seen the day before.  Then, ever so slowly, the hills began to get a little bigger and a little bigger.  Before long, we rounded a corner and, visible between the gap in a couple of hills, was a peek at our first snow covered mountain.

From there, the views just kept getting better and better, the peaks grander and grander.  It really was everything we had wished for.  The scenery was spectacular with one incredible vista followed by another, often times out both sides of the train.  It was frequently hard to know where to look.  There were rugged river valleys full of boulders huge boulders.  There were adorable little villages with their churches perched up on the highest points overlooking their parishioners.  There were incredible feats of engineer with tunnels bored through the mountains and fantastic spans of highway bridges lacing through steep valleys.  There were alpine chalets built on the sides of hills that made one wonder how they were even reachable.  There were gorgeous lakes with layers of homes and villages on the shores.

About half way through the trip, we were traveling along through a green valley surrounded by steep snow capped peaks.  We plunged into a tunnel for several minutes and, when we emerged, were greeted with an unbelievable winter wonderland.  The world was suddenly blanked with a think layer of snow and more was coming down.  This was only one of many moments where we gasped or exclaimed audibly.

The average speed of this train was much lower than the previous day's due to the extremely twisty route.  We rarely topped 80km/h.  The constant twists, turns, and tilting of the coach started to get to us about three hours in.  Carla was feeling the motion sickness worse than I was but I was definitely getting some myself.  A fizzy drink and some empty carbs from the snack car seemed to help.

The landscape leveled out into large but rolling hills the closer we got to Zurich.  The small towns grew larger and more frequent.  Eventually, we found ourselves gliding into the Zurich HB station right on schedule.  We were sorry the trip was over but looking forward to getting our feet on some firm ground.  We both could still feel the train moving under or feet for an hour or two.

From the very moment we stepped off the train, Zurich began assaulting us with the Christmas spirit and did not even for a moment let up.  I later described the town as a Hans Christian Andersen fever dream.  There was a little christmas market setup right in the station itself with cheerfully decorated stalls selling spiced wine, sweets, a variety of foods, and christmas merch.  This would turn out to be one of _many_ christmas markets setup throughout the town.  It was unbelievable.

Stepping out of the train station, thing only got more and more Christmasy.  The entire town was just dripping with christmas lights and decorations.  It was also absolutely buzzing with throngs of people shopping, celebrating, moving from here to there, etc.  Everything felt so festive and alive.

Dragging and carrying our luggage, we followed the route Google Maps had laid out for us which took us across the bridge and down along the river into old town.  In only about six or seven hundred meters, we were turning down an a little alley to find the Hotel Adler.  It's a charming older hotel but the rooms seem to have all the modern conveniences.  We somehow scored the biggest room on the first floor which included a huge luggage/closet area.

The hotel included a restaurant called the "Swiss Chuchi" which specialized in cheese.  WHile facing the front desk and checking in, the sliding door to the restaurant slid open and we were physically hit with the aroma of every cheese ever including all of the stinky ones.  Especially the stinky ones.  It was _very_ pungent.  That heady aroma would continue to pervade our stay at the Hotel Adler.

It was right around lunchtime at this point so we dropped our stuff off in our room and started looking for somewhere to eat.  It turned out that the Swiss Chuchi was the highest rated joint for half a kilometer around so we headed downstairs and plunged headlong into what would probably be the end result if Willy Wonka decided to specialize in cheese instead of chocolate.  If there were 60 menu items, 45 of them involved cheese.  There were over a dozen fondue options.  There was a large selection of raclette options.  There were items that might not normally involve cheese that were covered in cheese.  It wasn't just this place, though - there were a bunch of other restaurants around Zurich that specialized in fondues and raclettes, too.  The Swiss, it would seem, are all about living that cheese life.

In the end, we barely got any cheese.  Carla ordered some cheesy garlic bread to share, some Tomato soup. and a side of spaetzli which was served like a lite macaroni and cheese with veggies mixed in.  I had a scrumptious grilled bratwurst in onion gravy with a size of spaetzli.  It was all excellent.  The Swiss Chuchi, it turns out, is a very popular joint.  Even at lunchtime, nearly all the tables were reserved.  Later in the evening, the waiting line to get in was at least 15 deep.  Again, the Swiss and their cheese...  who knew?

We chilled in the room for a bit after lunch.  I went out for a quick solo walk and picked up a new stocking cap because Zurich was chilly during the day and going to get downright cold at night.  After I came back, we both went out for a walking tour of a town that one would be forgiven for assuming was decorated by Kris Goddamn Kringle himself.  Again, little Christmas markets everywhere.  Incredible decorations.  So many people out and about enjoying it all.  Such a festive vibe.

We looked up chocolatiers and found that the most highly spoken of establishment went by the name of "Max Chocolatier".  We found the tiny shop on a side street that was in the process of winding its way up a little hill.  The sample of chocolate was good so we picked up a bar and a few confections.  We were about to leave when the gent that gave us the first sample came out with a couple of small cups of hot chocolate for us to take with us.  And this hot chocolate... damn.  It was the finest hot chocolate that have ever passed these lips.  It was rich, robust, and creamy AF.  My eyes rolled into the back of my head on that first sip.

We made our way roughly down along the path of the river towards where it empties into Lake Zurich hitting another little Christmas market in the Munsterhof square just outside of the Fraumunster Church.  Adorable.  We kept walking and eventually wound up overlooking Lake Zurich itself.  We snapped a bunch of pics and headed across the bridge toward the old town side of the river where, right in front of the Opera House, we found the Christmas market to end all Christmas markets.  It was huge, adorable, and packed with all kinds of vendors.  There were tiny dogs wearing jackets, babies with rosie cheeks, folks drinking spiced wine, cider, and cocktails, and so much Christmas spirit that it almost made one angry.  It was the best.  We hung out here for a bit, took a buttload of pics and short videos, and had a couple of cocktails ourselves.

We started walking back in the direction of our hotel along the street that ran right along the river.  Carla found us some more hot chocolate that was nearly as good as first round.  We ventured up into the little walking streets of old town admiring the little shops and the occasional vender stall and ran right into yet another little Christmas market outside of the Grossmunster Church.  We went into the church and admired its stark, straightforward, very Lutheran feeling interior for a few minutes before moving on.  We slrolled along the the followed the Munstergasse and eventually wound up right back at the Adler hotel.

At this point, I knew that if I stopped moving for a few seconds that I'd fall asleep so I decided to head back out and do some more exploring.  It was just starting to get dark.  Carla's knee had had enough for one day so she stayed back at the hotel.  I crossed the river and found the little park that overlooks the river and old town and took some pics and vids.  I headed down the hill from there towards the downtown shopping area and ran right into a Christmas parade complete with floats and marching bands.  Just another layer of icing on this fifty layer Christmas cake.  I couldn't believe my luck.  I must have just caught the tail end of the parade, however, as after only one marching band and a couple of floats, the massive crowd of people that was downtown for the festivities engulfed the empty space of the parade route.

I wandered about for a bit and made my way towards the train station.  I didn't really get a good look at the train station the first time around so I thought I'd spend a few minutes checking it out and maybe watching a train or two arrive or depart.  On the far side of the broad street from the train station I discovered an escalator leading underground.  I figured it must be an underground walkway that led to the train station so I took it.  What I found was a giant underground mall roughly the size of four city blocks directly under the train station.  My mind was frickin' blown.  There more escalators in a few places that headed even deeper down into the earth to more platforms.  I'm still not sure if these platforms were for a metro or maybe for some inter city trains.

After emerging from this incredible underground labyrinth, I strolled around the train station for a few minutes admiring the architecture and the precision of the Swiss/Italian train system and moved on.  I crossed the river once more back to the old town side and strolled through the allies for a bit doing a bit of window shopping and people watching.  I wound up back at the hotel around 7:30 PM.

My ass was really draggin' by this point but I knew that if I went to bed now, I'd be up at 2:00 AM.  I decided to chill for a few minutes and head back out again.  I relaxed for a few minutes while Carla took a hot bath to help sooth her angry left knee.  I fought sleep with everything I had but might have dozed for a few minutes.  Just a few minutes!  It doesn't count!

I remembered that I had this magnetic tripod for my iPhone so I decided that I'd head back out and try to get some cool nighttime time lapses of nighttime Zurich.  I captured a few from the park overlooking the river and old town and a bunch more downtown.  Most of them had Zurich's super cool street cars in them.  I'm a sucker for a good streetcar.  The air was getting extra crisp and the throngs of holiday revelers were thinning out by 9:00 PM so I decided that I'd had enough and headed back to the hotel for the final time.  I did get some really lovely time lapses.

I took a quick shower and we both crashed into our shoved-together twin beds around 10:00 PM.  I fell asleep, as they say, before my head hit the pillow.  I was ready for a long, full night of restful sleep.  The bed was comfy.  The window was cracked.  The comforter was warm and snuggly.  The conditions were absolutely perfect.  Naturally, I was wide awake at 2:00 AM.

## Day Five - Zurich to Paris

* Breakfast
* Nap
* Hot Chocolate
* Lunch
* Train Station

Carla told me that she was actually awake at midnight.  Neither of us managed to get back to sleep.  WTF?  We've never had this much trouble adjusting to the local timezone before.  I might need to see about bringing along some pharmaceutical assistance on future trips if this is the way it's going to be.

After reading on our iPhones for a few hours, we headed down to the Swiss Chuchi for breakfast.  The spread was ok but it needed more protein.  There was a chafing dish lableed "scrambled eggs" which actually held some medium-boiled eggs still in their shells.  The cheese selection was decent but not what I imagined we'd find in this joint.  The at least had the essentials: coffee, croissants, and fruit preserves.  I prefer orange marmalade but instead made due with some peach preserves.  Over all, it was decent.

Afterwards, we went back upstairs to try to see if we could get a few more winks.  Carla laid down and drifted off pretty quickly.  I worked on this travel log for a bit and, around 8:30 AM, laid down and got another hour and a half myself.  By the time we got up, packed up, and got ourselves ready, it was about 11:00 AM.  We checked out of the hotel and had 'em hang on to our luggage for us so that we could go out and do a last bit of exploring.  

The first order of business was to find a hot chocolate joint and, oh boy, did we find a good one.  It was called the Schokolade & Espresso Bar and they basically had, like, a hot chocolate barista.  Carla went wite the "intense" hot chocolate and I got the more smooth and fruity one.  They were both fantastic.  We sat outside on the bench and sipped 'em into delicious oblivion.  

Following that, we did a little bit more exploring around the old town and came across the Burton shop.  I neglected to pack any kind of warm base layer other than some flannel shirts and had actually been looking for exactly something like the Burton store.  We browsed the racks and came across a little old Jack Russell terrier wearing what appeared to be a bespoke cable knit sweater snuggled up in a dog bed.  He was so chill and so sweet.  We both gave him some scratches behind the ears and he started following Carla around the shop.  I eventually found a nice medium weight long sleeve t-shirt with BRTN written across the chest for a reasonable amount of Swiss Francs.  I purchased it and immediately slipped it on.  It was exactly what I was looking for.

It was not about Noon and, having eaten breakfast nearly six hours prior, we decided to find some lunch.  I was looking for something light like a quick sandwich.  Google Maps revealed a 4.9 rated sandwich shop called "Al Paso" right by our hotel so we headed over there.  I had the pastrami, Carla had the Italian vegetarian, and we both had a cup of pea soup.  It was all superb.  There was only the tiny counter inside and two tiny tables outside so we took one of those.  By the time we left, there was a line out the door.  This was _the_ spot for sandwiches it would seem.

Following an excellent morning in Zurich, it was time to head to the train station.  I picked up our bags from the hotel front desk and we walked back to Zurich HB.  We were still over an hour from our departure time so we found a little cafe, ordered a couple of cappuccinos, and chilled for a bit.  The train station is open air and we were sitting outside again.  I grabbed a blanket from the back of one of the cafe chairs to throw across my legs.

It's at this point that I should mention that folks love open air dining in Zurich despite the frosty temperatures.  Most people seem to be well accustomed to the frosty temps.  A lot of restaurants with outside tables will provide furs and/or blankets for the more adventurous patrons that are down for a bit of mid-winter al fresco dining.

While we were sitting at our little outdoor table sipping our drinks and waiting for our train to pop up on the departure board, our coach companion, Tim, from yesterday's train ride through the alps found us and sat down at the next table.  He wasn't going anywhere today, just hanging out at the train station and grabbing a bite to eat.  We chatted about the joys of international travel for the next half hour until it was time to board the TGV Lyria No. 9222 that'd be taking us to Paris.  It was waiting for us on platform 13.

Being a rail enthusiast, I've dreamed for years about rocketing across the French countryside in a TGV so this one was special for me.  We found coach 11 at the very back of the train and found seats 25 and 26 on the bottom level.  Oh, yeah, this one was a double-decker.  At 1:34 PM almost to the second, the train pulled out of Zurich HB and _immediately_ started cruising along at speeds well above anything that we saw on the previous day's journey.  If I had to guess, I'd say we were tearing through the little stations outside of Zurich at a buttery smooth 70-80 MPH.  We had a little trouble finding space for our luggage in the luggage rack due to and older French couple monopolizing the space with the ridiculous number of bags that they dragged onboard.  Carla's roller back fit in the rack but I had to stuff my big backpack under our first class seats.  It actually fit like the space was made just for it.  The little bag for all the electronics fit nicely in the overhead rack above my seat.
